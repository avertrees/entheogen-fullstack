**What are you most afraid about X (the fearful thing)?**

**If this feeling could talk, what would it say? If you weren’t afraid, what would you
do differently? How would you feel differently?**

**What can you do to switch your fear into an opportunity for bravery? What is the
best case scenario?**

**What is the opposite of this core fear / limiting belief that you can begin
choosing to practice believing/affirming? (I am a good person, I deserve
forgiveness, I am worthy of happiness)**

## Practice + [Click Here for the Practice Playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5ZaDeFE7JkP9ty3EpgytcP?si=09fb8176fa4240d3&nd=1)

1. Begin by shaking and moving this fear out of your body for 1 full song.
   Move however you’d like.
2. Sit down and imagine that you are your ideal protector, parent, or higher
   self. Hug yourself with one hand in your armpit and one on your shoulder
   and gently rock yourself, imagining you’re being held by an older version
   of you. Focus all of your energy on consoling yourself and telling yourself
   everything that the scared version of you needs to feel safe. Let any
   emotions move, focus on breathing deeply as you stroke & hold yourself.
3. Close your eyes and sit in complete stillness for a minute or two while
   listening to the playlist below. When thoughts come, practice letting them
   go, like clouds floating by.
