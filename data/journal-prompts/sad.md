For this practice, you will need a mirror.

Begin by moving intuitively to one full song that gives you all the feels. As you move/dance, just remember not to stop moving. Perhaps you just rock your hips, or do a slow yoga flow. Focus on moving the sadness, stirring it up to release it.

Repeat the affirmation “It is safe to feel” as you do this. If any tears need to flow, just allow them and repeat this affirmation.

Lay or sit down and think about the part of you that is sad. Perhaps it’s a younger version of you (your inner child or inner teen) focus on breathing as deeply and as slowly as you can and without getting stuck in the story, imagine the sad or hurt part of you and repeat the ho’oponopono mantra (I’m sorry, Please forgive me, Thank you, I love you) to every part of you and every part of the past that needs to
hear it with the intention of creating closure. Let any and all emotions flow.

Rub your hands together with the intention of creating the energy of love, happiness, healing or gratitude. When your hands begin to get tired, place one hand on your heart and one on your womb, and imagine that the positive energy is running through you and filling you up.

This step is optional. Go find a mirror and tell yourself everything you need to hear to feel better.
